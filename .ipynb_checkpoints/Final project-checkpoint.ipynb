    "Moving to a new city is always a big step. Choosing the right neighborhood in the new city is difficult because while descriptions can of course help, it's difficult to estimate the real character of a neighborhood. I will try to help people moving from Berlin to Munich or vice versa making that decision by clustering neighborhoods of these cities in one pool to create a groups with a similar character. Knowing the city you are moving from you should then be able to better estimate the character of the different neighborhoods in the new one."

A collection of venues at these locations will then be requested from the foursquare database to get the character of the neighborhood."
